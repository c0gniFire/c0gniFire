# 👋 Hi, I'm Dominik

**My primary engine is curiosity.** 
A deep need to understand systems from the ground up shapes how I learn and build.

I'm self‑taught and consistently set higher standards for my development. 
Mathematics is my primary language — I use it to model phenomena and their mechanisms through code.

I don’t limit myself to a single direction. When I learn, I go end‑to‑end — from first principles to implementation — and I don’t leave space for loose ends or vague understanding.  
I care about clarity, rigor, and testing ideas in practice. 

These are the areas I’m most drawn to right now:
- neuroscience‑inspired AI 🧬  
- machine learning 🤖  
- agent systems / agentic workflows 🕸️  
- programming languages 💻  
- physics engines & simulation 🌌  
- distributed systems, networks & graph structures 🌐  

Right now I’m building a job‑market scraper to analyze demand and tech trends in Poland.  
I’m also looking for open‑source projects around **AI agents**, **LLM frameworks**, or **RAG systems**.
