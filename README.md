# 👋 Hi, I'm Dominik

**My primary engine is curiosity.**  
A deep need to understand systems from the ground up shapes how I learn and build.

I'm self‑taught and consistently set higher standards for my development.  
Mathematics is my primary language — I use it to model phenomena and their mechanisms through code.


## 🧠 Interests & Focus

- Neuroscience‑inspired AI  
- Machine Learning  
- Agent Systems / Agentic Workflows  
- Programming Languages  
- Physics Engines & Simulation  
- Distributed Systems, Networks & Graph Structures


## 🔬 My Approach

I don’t limit myself to a single direction.  
When I learn, I go **end‑to‑end** from first principles to implementation — and I don’t leave space for loose ends or vague understanding.  
I value clarity, rigor, and building things that actually test ideas in practice.


## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- A job‑market scraper (to understand demand and technology trends in Poland)


## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open‑source projects around **AI agents**, **LLM frameworks**, or **RAG systems**
